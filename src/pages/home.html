      <p>For 20 years, the Marine Stewardship Council has been part of a team effort to keep oceans healthy and full of life.</p>
<p>By choosing the Blue Fish label, you can join us in this cause, making sure the fish you eat can be traced back to a sustainable source. For seafood today and for future generations. Keep it Wild.</p>
